### 1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.
1. I learned how to use JavaScript to generate a random color dynamically using HSL values.
2. I learned how to make a webpage responsive using media queries.
3. I learned how to add an event listener to a button to change the  background color when clicked.

### 2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilotâ€™s suggestions to suit your needs?
I customized the layout provided by Copilot to match myh own style,including the choice of fonts and their sizes. I also adjusted the colors suggested by AI to match my personal preference.

### 3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
When using copilot to generate the code, I can quickly get results but not fully understand how the code works.
When using it as an effective learning partner, i can ask questions, test different ideas and explore concepts more deeply. Using its suggestions this way helps me understand the concepts better and become more independent.

### 4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
1. Not fully understanding the code, which makes it harder to debug.
2. Missing out on learning the fundamental programming concepts.
3. Becoming too dependent on AI instead of trying to solve problems on my own.
